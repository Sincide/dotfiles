# Modular Dotfiles Installer - Development Log

## Overview
Decomposition of the monolithic `dotfiles-installer.sh` (2195 lines) into independent, modular scripts in the `newinst/` directory.

## Design Principles

### 1. Complete Independence âœ…
- Each script is fully standalone with no shared dependencies
- Scripts can be run individually or in sequence
- No external configuration files required

### 2. Package Management Strategy âœ…
- **One comprehensive package script** (not 6 separate) - easier to customize
- All package categories embedded as easily-editable arrays within the script
- User can customize by commenting/uncommenting packages directly
- Full yay output visibility with `--needed --noconfirm --overwrite '*'` flags

### 3. User Interface âœ…
- Basic functional interface with light ANSI coloring (blue info, green success, red error, yellow warning)
- No gum dependency for maximum compatibility
- Command-line arguments support for all scripts

### 4. Safety & Logging âœ…
- Individual log files per script in `~/dotfiles/logs/`
- Timestamped logs with detailed operation tracking
- Automatic backup creation for important system files
- Dry run support for all scripts

### 5. Idempotent Design âœ…
- All scripts handle both fresh installations and existing systems gracefully
- Smart detection of existing configurations with proper handling
- Safe to run multiple times without issues

- **Symlink management**: Proper detection and repair of broken/incorrect symlinks
- **Backup systems**: Automatic timestamped backups before modifications
- **Safe re-runs**: All scripts can be safely executed multiple times

### User Experience
- **Comprehensive help**: All scripts have detailed `--help` output with examples
- **Dry run support**: Preview mode for all scripts to see what would be done
- **Flexible execution**: Individual script execution or full sequence
- **Detailed logging**: Comprehensive logs with timestamps for troubleshooting

## Next Steps for User Testing

1. **Test individual scripts** in order:
   ```bash
   cd ~/dotfiles/newinst/
   ./00-prerequisites.sh
   ./01-setup-chaotic-aur.sh
   ./02-install-packages.sh  # Customize packages as needed
   ./03-deploy-dotfiles.sh
   # ... continue with remaining scripts
   ```

2. **Use dry run mode** to preview changes:
   ```bash
   ./04-setup-theming.sh -n
   ./05-setup-external-drives.sh -n
   # etc.
   ```

3. **Skip sections** as needed:
   ```bash
   ./07-setup-ollama.sh --skip-models     # Install Ollama without models
   ./09-system-optimization.sh --skip-zram # Optimize without ZRAM
   ```

4. **Check logs** for any issues:
   ```bash
   ls ~/dotfiles/logs/
   ```

## Success Metrics
