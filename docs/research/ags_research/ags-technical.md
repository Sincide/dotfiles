# AGS/Astal Technical Implementation Guide

AGS (Aylur's GTK Shell) has evolved from a monolithic JavaScript framework to a sophisticated scaffolding system for Astal, a collection of Vala/C libraries designed for building desktop shells on Wayland. This guide provides deep technical analysis of the complete ecosystem, covering architecture, implementation patterns, and production-ready practices essential for modern desktop shell development.

## Technical architecture evolution

AGS underwent fundamental reimplementation between v1 and v2, representing a complete architectural shift from monolithic to modular design. **AGS v1** operated as a unified JavaScript framework with built-in services, global namespaces, and DBus communication. The system bundled battery, network, audio, and compositor integration into a single runtime environment using GJS exclusively.

**AGS v2/Astal** represents a complete rewrite where AGS serves purely as a scaffolding CLI tool, while Astal provides the core functionality through standalone Vala/C libraries. This modular approach enables language-agnostic development through GObject Introspection, with TypeScript/JSX as the primary development experience. The architecture eliminates DBus dependencies in favor of socket-based communication and implements a microservices approach where each system service exists as an independent library.

### Core library ecosystem

The Astal suite consists of foundational libraries and specialized service modules. **Core infrastructure** includes `astal3/astal4` for GTK widgets and window management using gtk-layer-shell, `astal-io` for process execution and file operations, and `Application` for CLI messaging via sockets. **Service libraries** provide domain-specific functionality: `astal-battery` for UPower integration, `astal-bluetooth` for Bluez communication, `astal-hyprland` for compositor IPC, `astal-network` for NetworkManager integration, and specialized modules like `astal-mpris` for media control and `astal-notifd` for notification management.

### Migration requirements and breaking changes

The transition from v1 to v2 requires extensive code rewriting. **Import systems** change from `Service.import("battery")` and `resource:///com/github/aylur/ags` to modern `import Battery from "gi://AstalBattery"` and `import { Widget } from "astal/gtk3"`. **Variable systems** replace polling syntax from `Variable("0", { poll: [1000, "command"] })` to `Variable("initial").poll(1000, "command")`. **Service registration** moves from AGS-specific `Service.register()` to GObject-based class inheritance with decorators.

**Window management** transforms from configuration-based `App.config({ windows: [...] })` to programmatic JSX approach with `App.start({ main() { <window application={App}></window> } })`. The migration necessitates complete reinstallation, library dependency management, and project structure reorganization from `~/.config/ags` to project-based development.

## Real implementation analysis

### Production patterns from leading projects

Analysis of prominent AGS/Astal implementations reveals consistent architectural patterns and best practices. **Aylur/ags** demonstrates the official scaffolding approach with `ags init` for project creation, `ags types` for GObject binding generation, and `ags bundle` for deployment packaging. The official examples emphasize modular widget development and reactive state management.

**end-4/dots-hyprland** showcases advanced integration patterns including AI assistant integration with Gemini and Ollama, automatic color scheme generation from wallpapers, and sophisticated workspace grouping systems. The implementation demonstrates complex state management with workspace groups calculated as `Math.floor((workspaceId - 1) / 10)` and dynamic UI adaptation based on system state.

**Jas-SinghFSU/HyprPanel** exemplifies production multi-monitor handling with improved GDK monitor mapping, modular panel architecture with configurable components, and extensive theming capabilities. The project structure emphasizes clean separation between widget components, service layers, and configuration management.

### Component architecture patterns

Modern AGS/Astal projects consistently implement **functional component patterns** using JSX syntax for declarative UI definition. Stateful components leverage the Variable system for reactive state management, with patterns like `const count = Variable(0)` and `bind(count).as(num => num.toString())` for UI updates. **Service integration** follows established patterns of importing Astal libraries and binding to GObject properties for real-time system integration.

**Widget lifecycle management** implements setup hooks for initialization, connection management for signal handling, and cleanup procedures for resource disposal. The pattern `setup={self => { self.hook(variable, callback) }}` provides standardized event handling with automatic cleanup on widget destruction.

## Advanced technical implementation

### Multi-monitor and window management

Multi-monitor support requires manual detection and window creation since AGS windows cannot span multiple displays automatically. **Monitor detection** uses GDK Display API to enumerate available monitors and create dedicated window instances. Dynamic monitor management implements event listeners for `monitor-added` and `monitor-removed` signals to adapt to hardware changes.

**Window positioning** leverages gtk-layer-shell for Wayland layer surface management, enabling precise anchor positioning with `anchor="top left right"` and exclusive zone configuration for space reservation. The layer system provides z-order control and input handling capabilities essential for desktop shell functionality.

### Service communication and reactive patterns

**Modern service architecture** replaces AGS v1's built-in services with direct Astal library imports and GObject property binding. Services communicate through standard GObject signals with automatic type safety through GObject Introspection. **IPC patterns** include socket-based CLI communication, DBus integration for system services, and direct compositor protocol support for window managers like Hyprland.

**Variable system** provides sophisticated reactive programming with polling, file watching, and derived state computation. Advanced patterns include `Variable.derive([var1, var2], (a, b) => a + b)` for computed values and error handling with `onError()` callbacks for robust service integration.

### Performance optimization and memory management

**Memory management** leverages GJS garbage collection with reference counting and cycle detection. Best practices include avoiding circular references between GObjects, implementing proper event listener disposal, and using WeakRefs for callback registration. Resource cleanup patterns use `ResourceManager` classes to track disposable resources and implement bulk cleanup on component destruction.

**Performance optimization** focuses on efficient widget updates through debouncing, minimizing CSS parser overhead with optimized selectors, and leveraging hardware acceleration for animations. Critical areas include CSS parsing efficiency, widget tree optimization, and network request batching for external service integration.

## Widget systems and styling engines

### Widget API and component patterns

AGS/Astal widgets extend GTK widgets with additional abstractions for declarative programming. **Widget hierarchy** follows standard GTK patterns with Astal-specific enhancements for desktop shell requirements. Components support **setup hooks** for initialization, **property binding** for reactive updates, and **lifecycle management** for resource cleanup.

**Custom widget development** uses the `astalify` mixin to create GObject-based components with full GTK integration. Advanced patterns include **widget composition** with JSX syntax, **property binding** with automatic type conversion, and **state management** through Variable integration.

### CSS styling and theming architecture

**GTK CSS implementation** differs significantly from web CSS, with widget-specific selectors and GTK-specific properties. The styling engine supports **CSS node structures** where complex widgets expose internal elements for styling, such as `scale trough` and `scale slider` for slider components.

**SCSS preprocessing** enables advanced theming with variables, mixins, and function-based color manipulation. Theme systems implement **CSS custom properties** for runtime color switching and **dynamic theming** with color extraction from wallpapers and system integration.

**Performance considerations** focus on selector efficiency, avoiding expensive universal selectors, and using hardware acceleration hints with `will-change` and `transform` properties. CSS parsing can block rendering, requiring careful optimization of stylesheet complexity.

## Best practices and development workflows

### Project organization and modular design

**Production project structure** emphasizes clear separation of concerns with dedicated directories for widgets, services, utilities, and configuration. Component architecture follows **Base class patterns** with abstract widget and service classes providing common functionality and lifecycle management.

**Configuration management** implements **environment-based configuration** with development and production modes, **schema validation** using libraries like Zod for type safety, and **hot-reloading** capabilities for development efficiency.

### Development tooling and testing strategies

**Build system optimization** uses ESBuild for TypeScript compilation with external module handling for Astal libraries. **Dependency management** varies by distribution, with NixOS providing flake-based development environments and Arch Linux offering AUR packages.

**Testing strategies** include unit testing with Vitest for component logic, integration testing for service interactions, and manual testing in live desktop environments. **Error handling** implements centralized error management with typed error handlers and monitoring integration.

### Security and deployment considerations

**Security practices** include input validation for shell commands, path validation for configuration files, and HTML escaping for dynamic content. **Deployment patterns** support various distribution methods from single-user installations to system-wide packages across multiple Linux distributions.

**Performance monitoring** tracks widget creation cycles, memory usage patterns, and system resource utilization to ensure efficient desktop shell operation. Production deployments implement **logging systems** with structured output and **debugging capabilities** with source map support.

## Code examples and implementation patterns

### Reactive state management

```typescript
// Advanced variable composition
const systemStatus = Variable.derive(
  [batteryService, 'percentage'],
  [networkService, 'connectivity'],
  (battery, network) => ({
    battery: battery.percentage,
    network: network.connectivity,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  })
);

// Efficient polling with error handling
const cpuUsage = Variable(0)
  .poll(2000, "top -bn1 | grep 'Cpu(s)' | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/%us,//'")
  .onError(() => 0);
```

### Widget component patterns

```typescript
// Functional component with props
interface StatusWidgetProps {
  services: ServiceConfig[];
  layout: 'horizontal' | 'vertical';
}

function StatusWidget({ services, layout }: StatusWidgetProps) {
  return (
    <box orientation={layout} spacing={8}>
      {services.map(service => (
        <ServiceIndicator key={service.name} config={service} />
      ))}
    </box>
  );
}

// Stateful component with lifecycle management
function DynamicCounter() {
  const count = Variable(0);
  
  return (
    <box
      setup={self => {
        const interval = setInterval(() => {
          count.set(count.get() + 1);
        }, 1000);
        
        self.connect('destroy', () => {
          clearInterval(interval);
        });
      }}
    >
      <label label={bind(count).as(n => `Count: ${n}`)} />
    </box>
  );
}
```

### Service integration patterns

```typescript
// Modern service integration
import Battery from "gi://AstalBattery";
import Network from "gi://AstalNetwork";

const battery = Battery.get_default();
const network = Network.get_default();

// Reactive binding to GObject properties
const batteryWidget = (
  <box spacing={8}>
    <icon icon={bind(battery, "batteryIconName")} />
    <label label={bind(battery, "percentage").as(p => `${p}%`)} />
    <progressbar
      value={bind(battery, "percentage").as(p => p / 100)}
      className={bind(battery, "charging").as(c => c ? "charging" : "")}
    />
  </box>
);

// Service communication with error handling
class SystemService extends GObject.Object {
  @GObject.property(String)
  declare status: string;
  
  async updateStatus() {
    try {
      const data = await this.fetchSystemData();
      this.status = data.status;
      this.emit('status-updated', data);
    } catch (error) {
      this.handleError(error);
    }
  }
}
```

### Multi-monitor implementation

```typescript
// Multi-monitor window management
function initializeShell() {
  const monitors = App.get_monitors();
  
  monitors.forEach((monitor, index) => {
    const panel = (
      <window
        name={`panel-${index}`}
        monitor={index}
        anchor="top left right"
        exclusivity="exclusive"
      >
        <StatusBar monitor={index} />
      </window>
    );
    
    App.add_window(panel);
  });
  
  // Dynamic monitor handling
  App.connect('monitor-added', (app, monitor) => {
    const newPanel = createPanelForMonitor(monitor.get_id());
    App.add_window(newPanel);
  });
}
```

### Advanced theming and styling

```scss
// Theme system with CSS custom properties
:root {
  --color-primary: #3498db;
  --color-secondary: #2ecc71;
  --color-surface: #ffffff;
  --color-background: #f8f9fa;
  --border-radius: 8px;
  --spacing-unit: 8px;
}

// Efficient widget styling
.status-bar {
  background: var(--color-surface);
  border-radius: var(--border-radius);
  padding: var(--spacing-unit);
  margin: var(--spacing-unit);
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  
  .widget {
    margin: 0 calc(var(--spacing-unit) / 2);
    transition: all 200ms ease;
    
    &:hover {
      transform: scale(1.02);
    }
  }
}

// Hardware acceleration hints
.animated-element {
  will-change: transform;
  transform: translateZ(0);
}
```
