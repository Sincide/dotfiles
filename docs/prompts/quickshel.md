I want to build a custom QuickShell configuration from scratch for my Arch Linux + Hyprland setup. I need an assistant that follows strict development rules and asks questions instead of making assumptions.

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. **NO Wayland commands** - Don't run any wayland/hyprland commands directly
2. **MUST read all research documents first** - Read and understand all docs before starting
3. **Start with empty folders** - I will delete any existing quickshell folders, start fresh
4. **Always update devlog** - Keep `docs/QUICKSHELL_CUSTOM_BUILD_DEVLOG.md` updated after each step
5. **ASK, don't assume** - If questions arise about layout, design, or implementation, ASK ME
6. **No assumptions about preferences** - Ask for my input on design decisions

**My System Setup:**
- OS: Arch Linux 6.15.2-arch1-1
- Shell: /usr/bin/fish  
- Workspace: /home/martin/dotfiles
- Compositor: Hyprland 0.49.0
- Displays: 5120x1440 ultrawide + 2x 2560x1440 @ 120-165Hz
- Current bar: Waybar (keeping during development)
- Theming: Matugen with dynamic color generation

**REQUIRED READING (Read these documents FIRST):**
1. `docs/QUICKSHELL_TECHNICAL_KNOWLEDGE.md` - All API patterns, compatibility issues, best practices
2. `docs/QUICKSHELL_ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis of complex QuickShell configuration  
3. `docs/QUICKSHELL_INTEGRATION_DEVLOG.md` - Previous integration attempt and lessons learned
4. `docs/QUICKSHELL_CUSTOM_BUILD_DEVLOG.md` - Current development plan and goals
5. `docs/research/` folder - Any additional research documents

**Current State:**
- `quickshell/` folder will be EMPTY when you start
- `matugen/templates/quickshell.template` already exists and works
- `quickshell-illogical-impulse-backup/` contains reference configuration (complex, don't copy directly)

**Development Requirements:**
- **Incremental approach**: One small step at a time, test each component
- **Question-driven**: Ask me about layout preferences, design choices, feature priorities
- **Documentation-first**: Update devlog immediately after each step
- **Error-free**: No API compatibility issues, no layout warnings
- **Clean architecture**: Modular, maintainable code structure

**What I expect from you:**
1. **Read all documentation first** - Understand the technical knowledge and previous work
2. **Ask about design preferences** - Don't assume I want Material 3, specific layouts, etc.
3. **Propose each step** - Explain what you want to build and ask for approval
4. **Update devlog religiously** - Mark steps complete, document issues, track progress
5. **Handle errors properly** - Use correct APIs, implement proper error handling

**Starting Questions you should ask me:**
- What visual style do I prefer? (Material 3, minimal, custom?)
- What bar height and positioning do I want?
- Which features are priority vs nice-to-have?
- How should multi-monitor behavior work?
- Any specific color scheme preferences beyond matugen?

**Technical Constraints (from research):**
- Must use `Process.startDetached()` not `Quickshell.execDetached()`
- QML IDs must be lowercase
- Always include proper imports
- Set explicit dimensions to avoid layout warnings
- Integrate with existing matugen pipeline

**Your first task:**
1. Read ALL the documentation files I mentioned
2. Ask me about my design preferences and priorities  
3. Propose the first development step
4. Update the devlog with our discussion

Remember: ASK, don't assume. I want to be involved in every design decision!



1. Visual Style & Layout Preferences
Do you want Material 3 design language, or prefer a more minimal/custom approach? Material 3
Bar positioning: Top only, or top+bottom like some configurations show? Top and bottom
Bar height preference? (The analysis shows 32-36px in examples) Thats fine
Multi-monitor behavior: Same content on all monitors or monitor-specific layouts? Same
2. Feature Priorities
Which features are must-have vs nice-to-have for the initial build? All, but lets add them 1 by 1 and verify they work
Workspace indicators Yes
System tray Yes
Media controls Yes
Clock/date Yes
System resources (CPU/RAM/temp) Yes
Notification system Yes
Quick toggles (brightness, volume) Yes
3. Multi-Monitor Strategy
With your ultrawide + dual 1440p setup:
Should the ultrawide be treated as the primary with more features? Yes
Different content per monitor or mirrored? Mirrored
Workspace distribution across monitors? Yes
4. Color & Theming
Stick with your existing matugen pipeline (seems comprehensive)? Yes
Transparency preferences? (Analysis mentions conservative values for readability) Yes
Dark mode only or light/dark switching? Only dark initially
5. Development Approach
Start with minimal top bar only? Yes
Which monitor should we test on first? Primary (ultrawide)
Keep Waybar running during development for fallback? Yes
