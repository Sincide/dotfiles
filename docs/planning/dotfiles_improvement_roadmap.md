## 🚨 CRITICAL FIXES (June 2025)

### **VM Testing Revealed Major Issues**
**Problem**: User tested installer in VM and discovered critical failures:
- ❌ **Package installation failures**: `papirus-icon-theme`, `bibata-cursor-theme`, `cinnamon-desktop`, `nemo-fileroller` all failing
- ❌ **Incorrect package names**: Many AUR packages have wrong/outdated names
- ❌ **Git cloning issues**: Precaching asking for GitHub credentials, unreliable
- ❌ **Deprecated themes**: Still referencing `nordic-theme-git` despite removal
- ❌ **Graphite theme**: User dislikes Graphite theme, needs replacement

### **URGENT FIXES COMPLETED** 
**Status**: ✅ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED & FIXED**
1. **✅ Package Name Corrections**:
   - `bibata-cursor-theme` → `bibata-cursor-git` (with hyprcursor support)
   - `nemo-fileroller` → `nemo` (fileroller included automatically)
   - Verified all package names against current AUR

2. **✅ Eliminate Git Cloning**:
   - Removed all manual git clone operations from installer
   - Using only official repos and AUR packages
   - WhiteSur: `whitesur-gtk-theme` + `whitesur-icon-theme` (AUR packages)

3. **✅ Better Theme Selection**:
   - **Replaced Graphite** with **Arc theme** (user preference)
   - Space/Gaming: `Arc-Dark` (popular, clean, flat design)
   - Nature: `Everforest-Dark` (beautiful nature-inspired colors)
   - Abstract: `Arc` (light variant)
   - All themes available as proper AUR packages

4. **🔧 Theme Package Sources**:
   - `orchis-theme` - **Official Arch repos** (Extra)
   - `arc-gtk-theme` - **AUR** (very popular, 7.55 rating)
   - `everforest-gtk-theme-git` - **AUR** (nature-inspired)
   - `whitesur-gtk-theme` - **AUR** (macOS-like)

5. **✅ Root Cause Identified**:
   - **Problem**: Installer was silencing ALL error output with `2>/dev/null`
   - **Fix**: Removed error suppression, added proper error handling
   - **Improvement**: Added fallback to pacman for official packages
   - **Better UX**: Clear success/failure messages instead of silent failures

### **Next Steps for Completion**
- [x] Identify root cause of installation failures (error suppression)
- [x] Implement proper error handling and fallback logic
- [ ] Test corrected installer in fresh VM
- [ ] Verify all packages install successfully with visible error messages
- [ ] Mark installer as production-ready after successful VM validation
