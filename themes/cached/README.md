# Theme Cache Directory

This directory stores downloaded themes locally to avoid re-downloading them on fresh installations.

## Directory Structure

```
themes/cached/
â”œâ”€â”€ gtk/          # GTK theme packages
â”œâ”€â”€ icons/        # Icon theme packages  
â”œâ”€â”€ cursors/      # Cursor theme packages
â””â”€â”€ README.md     # This file
```

## How It Works

1. **First Installation**: Themes are downloaded from git repositories and cached here
2. **Subsequent Installations**: Themes are installed directly from cache (much faster)
3. **Offline Support**: Cached themes can be installed without internet connection

## Management Commands

```bash
# Cache all available git-based themes
./scripts/theming/theme_cache_manager.sh cache-all

# List cached themes
./scripts/theming/theme_cache_manager.sh list

# Install specific theme (from cache if available)
./scripts/theming/theme_cache_manager.sh install <theme_name>

# Clean cache (remove all cached themes)
./scripts/theming/theme_cache_manager.sh clean
```

## What Gets Cached

**Git-based themes** (downloaded and cached):
- Nordic (GTK)
- Orchis-Green-Dark (GTK)
- Ultimate-Dark (GTK)
- WhiteSur-Light (GTK)
- Graphite-Dark (GTK)
- Tela-circle-green (Icons)
- WhiteSur (Icons)
- Qogir-dark (Icons)

**AUR packages** (installed directly, not cached):
- Yaru-Colors
- Papirus/Papirus-Dark
- Numix-Circle
- All Bibata cursor themes
- Capitaine-Cursors

## Benefits

- âš¡ **Faster installs**: Cached themes install in seconds
- ðŸ“¦ **Offline capability**: No internet needed for cached themes
- ðŸ”„ **Reliable**: No dependency on external git repositories being available
- ðŸ’¾ **Space efficient**: Only downloads themes you actually use
- ðŸŽ¯ **Portable**: Themes travel with your dotfiles

## Git Integration

The cache contents are ignored by git (see `.gitignore`) to avoid:
- Bloating the repository with large theme files
- Conflicts between different users' cached themes
- Version control issues with frequently-changing theme repositories

Only the directory structure (`.gitkeep` files) is tracked to ensure the cache system works immediately after cloning.
