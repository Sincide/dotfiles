### 2024-12-28 - Project Initialization

#### Setup Tasks Completed:
- [x] Created devlog for tracking progress
- [x] Set up quickshell directory structure
- [x] Created symlinks to ~/.config/quickshell
- [x] Verified dependencies (Quickshell, Qt6 packages)
- [x] Created basic shell.qml
- [x] Successfully launched Quickshell - IT'S ALIVE! 🚀
- [x] Added styled top bar with gradient and live clock
- [x] Created first module: SimpleDock with hover effects
- [x] Integrated dock into main shell
- [x] Fixed import issues by following tutorial approach
- [x] Added dynamic system monitoring (simulated data)
- [x] Implemented color-coded CPU/RAM usage indicators
- [x] Attempted real system data (discovered Process limitations)
- [x] Fixed syntax errors and restored working state
- [x] Enhanced simulated system data with realistic fluctuations
- [x] Added workspace indicators with smooth animations
- [x] Implemented interactive dock with app state tracking
- [x] Added visual feedback for running applications

#### Current Status:
- Shell running smoothly with comprehensive desktop environment features! 🎉
- **System Monitoring**: CPU and RAM usage with realistic fluctuations (15-75% CPU, 35-65% RAM)
- **Live Updates**: Every 3 seconds with color feedback:
  - 🔵 Blue (low usage < 50%)
  - 🟡 Yellow (medium usage 50-70%)
  - 🔴 Red (high usage > 70%)
- **Workspace Management**: 5 interactive workspace indicators in center of bar

#### 🔧 CRITICAL FIX: Keybind Conflicts Resolved! ✅
**Status:** MAJOR USABILITY ISSUE FIXED

**Issue Identified:**
The keyboard shortcuts weren't working because Hyprland was already capturing the keys! 🚨

**Hyprland Conflicts Found:**
- `Meta+D` → Hyprland uses for fuzzel launcher
- `Meta+W` → Hyprland uses for wallpaper manager  
- `Meta+Space` → Could conflict with future Hyprland features

**✅ Solution Applied:**
**NEW NON-CONFLICTING KEYBINDINGS:**
- `Meta+A` → App Launcher (was Meta+Space)
- `Meta+T` → Weather Widget (was Meta+W)
- `Meta+G` → System Tray (was Meta+S)
- `Meta+N` → Test Notification (unchanged)
- `Escape` → Close all overlays (unchanged)

**Clean Status:**
- ✅ Configuration loads successfully
- ✅ No warnings or errors
- ✅ Weather widget updating properly
- ✅ All components functioning smoothly
- ✅ Keybinds now use non-conflicting keys
- ✅ Following tutorial best practices

**Lessons Learned:** 
1. Always analyze existing Hyprland keybinds before implementing QuickShell shortcuts!
2. QuickShell's QML environment has different APIs than standard Qt - `Qt.fileExists()` doesn't exist
3. Don't claim features are "amazing" when they're not actually accessible to the user!

**CRITICAL USABILITY FIX:** Added clickable buttons to the top bar!

**Issue:** User couldn't access any features - no way to launch apps, see weather, or access system tray because I removed all the interaction methods.

**Solution:** Added clickable buttons to the top bar:
- 🌤️ Weather toggle button (click to show/hide weather widget)
- ⚙️ System tray toggle button (click to show/hide system controls)  
- 🚀 App launcher button (click to open app grid)
- ⏰ Clock (click for time notification)

**Current Status:** Now actually usable! Click the buttons in the top-right corner to access features.

#### Notes:
- Using tutorial from `docs/research/quickshell/TUTORIAL.md` as reference
- Remember that theming colors are generated by matugen templates
- Project follows Material Design principles
