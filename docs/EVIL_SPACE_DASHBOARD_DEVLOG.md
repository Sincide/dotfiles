- **API**: `dashboard/app/api/` contains Flask routes for serving data.
- **Frontend**: `dashboard/app/frontend/` contains frontend rendering logic.
- **Runner**: `evil_space_dashboard.py` at the root of `/dashboard` is the new main entry point.
- Static file serving for frontend assets
- JSON API for real-time data
- SQLite for persistent storage
- WebSocket-like polling for real-time updates

## Development Progress

### 2025-01-20 - Phase 2 Complete: Process & Network Monitoring Added
- ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED: Process monitoring with psutil integration.** Added `get_process_info()` function providing:
  - Total process count (458 processes detected)
  - Process status breakdown (running, sleeping, zombie, stopped)
  - Top 10 processes by CPU usage and memory consumption
  - Process details with PID, name, and resource usage
- ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED: Network monitoring with interface statistics.** Added `get_network_info()` function providing:
  - Active network interfaces (2 detected: enp5s0, virbr0)
  - Total data transfer statistics (8.29 GB received, 0.28 GB sent)
  - Active network connections (40 established connections)
  - Per-interface bandwidth statistics and error counts
- ‚úÖ **ENHANCED: Frontend with new monitoring cards.** Added Process Monitor and Network Status cards to overview tab and detailed views in system tab.
- ‚úÖ **VERIFIED: All new endpoints working.** Both `/api/processes` and `/api/network` endpoints return comprehensive monitoring data.
- üéØ **Phase 2 Status**: Real-time monitoring is now **FULLY COMPLETE** - System, GPU, Process, and Network monitoring all operational.

### 2025-01-20 - GPU Monitoring Fixed & psutil Integration Complete
- ‚úÖ **FIXED: GPU monitoring now working correctly.** Updated `get_gpu_info()` to use the correct `rocm-smi` command flags (`--showtemp --showuse --showmemuse --showfan --showpower --json`) instead of the non-functional `--json` alone.
- ‚úÖ **FIXED: JSON parsing updated** to match the actual field names returned by `rocm-smi` (e.g., `"Temperature (Sensor junction) (C)"`, `"GPU use (%)"`, `"Fan speed (%)"`, etc.).
- ‚úÖ **ENHANCED: psutil integration complete.** System monitoring now provides detailed memory, disk, and process information with 31.2GB RAM, 16 CPU cores, and 438 processes detected.
- ‚úÖ **FIXED: Port conflict issue resolved.** Improved launcher script with more aggressive port cleanup using both `pkill` and `fuser` to ensure port 8080 is properly cleared before starting.
- ‚úÖ **FIXED: Socket binding issue resolved.** Added `SO_REUSEADDR` socket option to the TCPServer to prevent "Address already in use" errors from TIME_WAIT states.
- ‚úÖ **VERIFIED: All monitoring endpoints working.** Both `/api/system` and `/api/gpu` endpoints return complete data:
  - **System**: CPU usage (11.8%), Memory (21.6% used), Disk (4.9% used), Load average, Uptime
  - **GPU**: AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT, 71¬∞C, 8% VRAM, 36% fan, 69W power draw
- üéØ **Phase 2 Status**: Real-time monitoring is now **COMPLETE** for system and GPU metrics.

### 2025-01-20 - Major Refactor & Bug Fixes
- ‚úÖ **REFACTORED: Monolithic script `evil_space_dashboard.py` was broken down into a modular application.** This significantly improves maintainability and scalability. The new structure separates core logic, API endpoints, and frontend rendering.
- ‚úÖ **FIXED: CPU monitoring now correctly calculates usage from `/proc/stat` instead of showing a static 100%.**
- üîÑ **IN PROGRESS: Fixing GPU monitoring.** The previous method of parsing `rocm-smi` text output was unreliable. Currently implementing a more robust solution by parsing its JSON output (`rocm-smi --json`).
- üêõ **BUG: Port conflict on startup.** The launcher script was updated to kill existing processes on port 8080, but this needs further testing to confirm it is resolved.
- üêõ **BUG: Scripts page displayed `[object Object]`.** This was fixed by sending the correct script count from the backend.

### 2025-01-19 - Phase 1 Complete
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive dashboard application (925 lines)
- ‚úÖ Implemented all 5 API endpoints: system, gpu, logs, themes, scripts
- ‚úÖ Built responsive Evil Space themed UI with glassmorphism design
- ‚úÖ Added adaptive update frequencies (2s active, 30s inactive)
- ‚úÖ Implemented SQLite database for persistent storage
- ‚úÖ Created Fish launcher script with dependency checking
- ‚úÖ Added ROCm GPU monitoring integration
- ‚úÖ Graceful fallback for missing dependencies (psutil)
- ‚úÖ **FIXED: Tab content rendering - replaced raw JSON dumps with proper HTML formatting**

## Status: Refactoring Complete. Fixing Monitoring Bugs.

## Phase 3: Enhanced Log Management System (June 21, 2025)

### üéØ **Major Log System Overhaul**

**Problem**: The log viewer was limited to only dashboard logs, had poor readability, and lacked proper log management.

**Solution**: Implemented a comprehensive multi-source log management system with automatic rotation and enhanced UX.

#### ‚úÖ **Multi-Source Log Integration**
- **Dashboard Logs**: Personal dotfiles logs with automatic rotation
- **System Logs**: `/var/log/` files (pacman, Xorg, kernel, auth, etc.)
- **Journal Logs**: Real-time systemd journal access via `journalctl`

#### ‚úÖ **Intelligent Log Rotation**
- **Auto-cleanup**: Keeps only 5 most recent logs per category
- **Category-based**: Groups logs by prefix (dashboard, setup, backup, etc.)
- **Space management**: Prevents log directory bloat

#### ‚úÖ **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Readable Names**: "Dashboard (2025-06-21 22:34:18)" instead of "dashboard_20250621_223418.log"
- **Organized Dropdown**: Grouped by source (Journal ‚Üí System ‚Üí Dashboard) with optgroups
- **Scrollable Interface**: Dropdown supports scrolling for many log files
- **Better Contrast**: Dark background with cyan accents for readability

#### ‚úÖ **Smart Log Parsing**
- **Timestamp Extraction**: Parses `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` format into readable dates
- **Category Detection**: Automatic categorization from filename patterns
- **System Log Mapping**: Friendly names for system logs (e.g., "Package Manager (Pacman)")
- **Size Display**: Shows file sizes in dropdown for context

#### ‚úÖ **Advanced Filtering & Search**
- **Real-time Journal**: Live systemd journal viewing with priority filtering
- **Level Filtering**: ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG with journalctl integration
- **Text Search**: Real-time search across all log sources
- **Boot Selection**: View logs from different boot sessions

#### üîß **Technical Implementation**
- **Subprocess Integration**: Safe `journalctl` execution with timeout protection
- **Path Handling**: Smart detection of absolute vs relative log paths
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for inaccessible logs
- **API Consistency**: Unified interface for all log sources

#### üìä **Log Statistics**
- **Multi-source Counts**: Dashboard (23), System (1), Journal (4)
- **Category Breakdown**: Automatic categorization and counting
- **Real-time Updates**: Live statistics for journal logs
- **File Metadata**: Size, modification time, line counts

## üêõ **CURRENT ISSUE: Log Level Filtering Bug (June 21, 2025)**

### Problem Description
Log level filtering is broken and causing UX issues:

1. **Filter Reset Issue**: When selecting a log level (e.g., "Errors"), the log content resets to "Select a log file" instead of showing filtered results
2. **Dropdown Clearing**: After applying a level filter, the log file dropdown appears to reset, preventing further log selection
3. **No Recovery**: Once the filter is applied and fails, users cannot select any log files until page refresh

### Technical Analysis
- **Backend Filtering**: Server-side filtering logic appears correct with proper journalctl priority mapping and file-based keyword detection
- **Frontend Integration**: Level filter changes call `refreshLogContent()` which should preserve the selected log file
- **Suspected Issue**: The `currentLogFile` variable or dropdown selection may be getting cleared when API returns empty results

### Attempted Fixes
1. ‚úÖ **Fixed journalctl priority mapping**: Changed ERROR from `'3'` to `'0..3'` for proper systemd priority ranges
2. ‚úÖ **Enhanced file-based filtering**: Improved keyword detection for ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG levels
3. ‚úÖ **Server-side filtering**: Modified frontend to send `filter_level` parameter to API instead of client-side filtering
4. ‚úÖ **Better error messaging**: Enhanced "no results" display with active filter information

### Next Steps
- **Debug frontend state**: Check if `currentLogFile` variable is being preserved during filtering
- **Investigate dropdown behavior**: Ensure log file selection remains intact when content is empty
- **Add fallback handling**: Preserve log selection even when filtering returns no results
- **Consider alternative approach**: Hybrid client/server filtering to maintain selection state

### Status: **NEEDS INVESTIGATION** üîç
