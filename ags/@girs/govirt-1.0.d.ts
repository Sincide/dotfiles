             * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
             * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
             * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
             * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
             * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
             * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
             *
             * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
             * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
             * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
             * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
             *
             * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
             * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
             * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
             * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
             * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
             * instance.
