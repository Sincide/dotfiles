# Evil Space Dashboard Development Log

## Project Overview
Comprehensive monitoring and management dashboard for the Evil Space dotfiles ecosystem.

## Initial Requirements (2025-01-19)
- **Interface**: Web-based dashboard (local only)
- **Technology**: Python with system packages only (no pip/venv)
- **Theme**: Static Evil Space aesthetic
- **Update Frequency**: Adaptive (2s active, 30s inactive, paused when hidden)
- **Storage**: File-based using JSON/SQLite in ~/dotfiles/dashboard/

## Features to Implement
### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [x] Technology stack decision: Python with built-in modules
- [ ] Basic web server with http.server
- [ ] Static Evil Space themed UI
- [ ] File-based storage system
- [ ] Basic routing and API endpoints

### Phase 2: Real-time Monitoring
- [ ] System resource monitoring (CPU, RAM, GPU)
- [ ] GPU metrics (temperature, fan, usage, VRAM, power)
- [ ] Process monitoring
- [ ] Network monitoring
- [ ] Adaptive update frequencies

### Phase 3: Log Management
- [ ] Log file discovery and parsing
- [ ] Log viewer with filtering/search
- [ ] Log analytics and insights
- [ ] Log rotation management

### Phase 4: Theme Management
- [ ] Current theme detection
- [ ] Wallpaper browser and selector
- [ ] Theme preview and switching
- [ ] Material You color extraction
- [ ] Custom theme creation

### Phase 5: AI Integration
- [ ] System health AI assistant
- [ ] Log analysis with insights
- [ ] Intelligent automation suggestions
- [ ] Chat interface for queries

### Phase 6: Script Management
- [ ] Script discovery and categorization
- [ ] Safe script execution (excluding setup scripts)
- [ ] Execution history and monitoring
- [ ] Custom script runner

## Development Notes
- Using Python 3.13.3 system installation
- No external dependencies via pip/pipx as per user requirements
- Built-in modules: http.server, json, sqlite3, os, subprocess, threading
- Fish shell integration for script execution
- Centralized logging to ~/dotfiles/logs/

## Architecture Decisions
- Single-file Python application for simplicity
- Static file serving for frontend assets
- JSON API for real-time data
- SQLite for persistent storage
- WebSocket-like polling for real-time updates
