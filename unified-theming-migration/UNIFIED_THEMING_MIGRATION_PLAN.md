# Unified Dynamic Theming Migration Plan
## Comprehensive Implementation Strategy for Sincide Dotfiles

---

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the migration from the current multi-theme dynamic system to a unified, linkfrg-inspired dynamic theming approach. The migration preserves all existing functionality while addressing identified bugs, performance issues, and GTK4/libadwaita limitations.

**Key Goals:**
- Unify theming under a single dynamic GTK theme
- Preserve all per-category mappings (icons, cursors, wallpaper behaviors)
- Address identified bugs and performance issues
- Enhance GTK4/libadwaita compatibility
- Maintain backward compatibility and rollback capabilities

---

## Phase 1: Security Fixes and Critical Bug Resolution

### 1.1 Immediate Security Issues

#### GPU Monitoring Script Hardening
**Issue:** Hard-coded GPU card index assumptions could fail on different systems

**Implementation:**
- [x] Fixed inconsistent card paths (amdgpu_check.sh used card0, others used card1)
- [x] All GPU scripts now consistently use card1 (correct for user's AMD RX 7900)
- [x] Verified GPU monitoring works correctly
- [x] Kept solution simple (AMD-only, no NVIDIA detection needed)

### 1.2 Fish Shell Conflict Resolution

#### Alias/Abbreviation Deduplication
**Issue:** Conflicting Git shortcuts causing unpredictable behavior

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Audit all Fish aliases and abbreviations
- [ ] Remove duplicates, preferring abbreviations for interactive use
- [ ] Document the chosen approach for consistency
- [ ] Test all Git workflow shortcuts

#### Fish Color Variable Fix
**Issue:** `set -u fish_color_option` should be `set -U`

**Implementation:**
- [x] Fix the typo in fish color configuration
- [x] Verify all other universal variables use `-U`
- [ ] Test Fish shell color consistency

- [ ] Add application-specific refresh logic

#### Comprehensive App Coverage
- [ ] Waybar: Dynamic reload with new colors
- [ ] Kitty: Signal-based theme refresh
